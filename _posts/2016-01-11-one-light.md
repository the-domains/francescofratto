ONE LIGHT

News are
like bullets, incessantly being fired at us.

There's
hardly any time to take a front page photo when the next tragedy is urging to
be told. 

Newspaper
headlines seem to stress the beats our flowing lives tap to. 

We haven't
got enough time any more to study events and to try to understand.

This
photography project was intended from its very start to help viewers think -- out
of the box -- about the issue of migration based on the experience of a small local
community that, in a very short time, has become a tangible example of
integration and solidarity. This was made possible by a group of volunteers who
took care -- with civic passion and humanity -- of about fifty migrants being sheltered
in a provisional facility in the Veneto region for nearly two months.

All the
portraits included in this series were shot at the end of
September 2015, the night before this diverse, multi-ethnic 'community' was scattered
once again and destined to different locations.

'One Light'
intends to be a tactful way to look into these young people's eyes and perceive
the worries and hopes they harbored during their long and dramatic journey.
It's an invitation to face an inconvenient reality that one often tends to
ignore or shove under a thick layer of platitudes and misconceptions.
